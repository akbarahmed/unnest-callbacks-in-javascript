# unnest-callbacks-in-javascript

## Overview

This project contains some sample code that I wrote for a lightening talk I gave at [BayNode](http://www.meetup.com/BayNode) on March 5, 2014. The sample code highlights a few approaches to unnesting callbacks in JavaScript to both improve code readability and to increase performance. 

The performance tuning aspects are 100% from [Trevor Norris](https://twitter.com/trevnorris) who's talk on [Performance Sins of our Abstractions](http://exponential.io/blog/nodeday-2014-performance-sins-of-our-abstractions) at NodeDay validated the benefits of an unnested approach and served as the inspiration for this talk. If you're really into high performance Node development, then Trevor is someone you should follow.
